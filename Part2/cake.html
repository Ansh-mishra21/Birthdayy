                Happy Birthday!

                Today is all about you â€” your light, your soul, your everything. Thereâ€™s something about you that words
                canâ€™t quite enough to describe you, but Iâ€™ll try . The way you move through life with grace and happiness, the way you see the
                world, the way your presence changes the atmosphere â€” itâ€™s magic. Youâ€™re magic and I am so glad that I meet you in this life
                
                I like talk with you fir chahe woh 2 min ki baat ho ya 1hr ki hi kyuu na ho, hmari ladayii bhi bht hui hai pehle abhi bhi hoti hai aage bhi hoti rhegii but most important yeh hai ki kuch bhi ho hmarii dosti bnii rehti hai. I wish ki hmarii dosti or lambhi chale or me tujhsee kabhi ek br mil sakuu ...  

                You donâ€™t even realize how beautiful cute sundarr naarii you are, how much you means to me, how much your presence matter for me and sometimes I think how lucky I am to have you as my favourite friend and something I also think ki me shyd deserve nahii karta tera dost hona because you are too good for me and I am not I am stupid you know it. Soo thanks a lot to be my shakii

                less because you are the best so you deserve everything best .
